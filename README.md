# Blog-Website

A Blog Website made using Python and the module Flask. All Website design is made by me while most of the backend has been done following a tutorial form Corey Schafer.
If you would like to see this proyect feel free to clone or download the code and it is just as easy as running the file *run.py*.

**It is currently not deployed, but I’m planning on deploying it soon.**

## About
I'm making a Blog as my first Flask project. This project started following a Youtube tutorial form Corey Schafer, and although I still follow some of his tutorials, but now I am putting my own spin to it at the moment. This project has really opened my eyes to website design which I really like and really try to get better over time. As well, this has been my biggest project so far which has taught me a lot about managing a project. 

## Working on Now
Currently I’m working on making the email password reset system work properly as well as fixing some bugs.
 
Any tips, suggestion or feedback is super welcome and even encouraged!
